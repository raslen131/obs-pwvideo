# OBS PipeWire Video Source

This source is a fork of the OBS PipeWire video code (used for screen/window capture on Wayland and PipeWire webcam capture), modified to work as a generic video source. It is the video counterpart to the JACK audio source, and serves a similar purpose as the Spout2 and Syphon sources on Windows and macOS, respectively.

It is designed to work with apps that can send video using PipeWire, such as those using [libfunnel](https://github.com/hoshinolina/libfunnel/).

This fork also serves as a testbed for improvements to the OBS PipeWire code, which can hopefully be upstreamed over time.

## Differences with the built-in OBS PipeWire support

* No portals used/required (this still works in Flatpak as the Flatpak already has PipeWire permissions to support the JACK source)
* Improved PipeWire video support (bugfixes, support for double buffering, and lazy mode for pull-based frame pacing)
* Support for selecting arbitrary PipeWire video sources and auto-reconnect without user action (WIP)

## Why not portals?

Portals are a great concept. Unfortunately, xdg-desktop-portal doesn't really support this use case currently, and it would require multiple changes to work well:

* Implementation of [App to App Media Sharing](https://github.com/flatpak/xdg-desktop-portal/discussions/1141)
* A refactor of session resume to be more robust and reliable (the current approach is not appropriate for professional streaming setups)
* Support for a coarse-permissioned "user-managed" mode for power users who wish to manage video stream connections manually (e.g. with qpwgraph)

If and when these features make it into xdg-desktop-portal, then this plugin will be archived and users will be able to transition to a portal-enabled solution, which would be bundled with OBS instead of being a separate plugin.
